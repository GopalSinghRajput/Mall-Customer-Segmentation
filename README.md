# Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis with Python


## Overview

This project is a customer segmentation analysis using Python, focusing on customer data from a mall. Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy, helping businesses understand their customer base better and tailor their marketing efforts accordingly.

In this analysis, we will explore customer data, perform segmentation, and visualize the results using various Python libraries. The primary goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their behavior, demographics, and preferences.
